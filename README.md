Learn Git: Branching and Collaboration
Birthday Party
Let’s practice some Git branching.

In this project, you’ll be using Git to make a 1-page website for your friend Kay’s birthday party.

index.html is written in HTML. Don’t be afraid! You won’t be asked to write any HTML from scratch. If you’re interested in learning HTML, check out Codecademy’s HTML course.
